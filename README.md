My first repo
My name is Adrian Acevedo, I am a game design student at Southwest Career and Technical Academy. I am currently in 11th grade in the Game Design program finishing Digital Game Design II and Animation III this year. 
My interests in game development heavily rely on the design aspects of game development, mostly things like character design, concept art, and things of that sort.
I didn't really learn any language in particular, kind of touched on Javascript and computer science but is willing to learn more about other types of scripting languages.
